# LaTeX Developer CV Template

A professional, minimal, and customizable LaTeX resume/CV template designed for software developers, engineers, and other tech professionals.

This template uses clear sectioning, optimized spacing, and simple design to ensure your resume looks clean and focused. Personal information and real company names have been replaced with placeholder values (`Test`, `Sample`, etc.) to allow you to easily customize and reuse this format for your own resume.
